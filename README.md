# TwitterApplication
An application which reads latest 10 tweets from a user time.
Created an MVC web App using jquery to fetch data asynchronously.
The Application usually polls every 1min to retrieve the newly added tweets.
Implemented the major functionality i.e retrieving the latest tweets and added a search field for user to filter tweets.
Covered important functionality with Unit tests using Moq and Unity Container for Dependency resolution.
Placed required comments where ever necessary.
The Front End has a search functionality that a user can type a string from the tweet content.
Also one may able to clear the search field and get back the latest tweets.
Please Clone and Download the App locally to inspect the code and run it on one's own machine.
However,this Application is hosted on Azure as a web App and one may hit the below URL to test the functionality.
