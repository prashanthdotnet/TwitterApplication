# TwitterApplication
An application which reads latest 10 tweets from a user time line based on certain time interval.
Created an MVC web App using jquery to fetch data asynchronously.
Implemented the major functionality i.e retrieving the latest tweets and added a search field for user to filter tweets.
Covered important functionality with Unit tests using Moq and Unity Container for Dependency resolution.
Placed required comments whereever necessary.
